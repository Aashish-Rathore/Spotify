Spotify Clone

Live Demo:

This repository contains a basic recreation of Spotify's UI using HTML and CSS. This is my first web development project, and I've learned a lot through the process of building it, including making and overcoming numerous challenges.

Features:

Fully designed interface: Replicates the visual appearance of Spotify's main screen.
Sidebar navigation: Includes a functional sidebar with key navigation options.
Music player bar: Features a styled music player bar at the bottom of the screen.
Dark theme: Adheres to Spotify's signature dark theme for a visually consistent experience.
Current Limitations:

Not currently mobile-responsive: This project is designed for desktop viewing and may not display correctly on smaller screens.
No functionality: The UI elements are purely for visual representation and do not have any interactive features.
Future Improvements:

Mobile responsiveness: Implement responsive design to ensure the UI adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
Add functionality: Integrate JavaScript to enable basic music playback controls (play, pause, skip, volume).
Enhance features: Explore adding more advanced features like playlists, search, and user profiles.
